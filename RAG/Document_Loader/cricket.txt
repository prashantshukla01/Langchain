The Willow and the Leather
Upon a field of vibrant green,
The finest sight that I have seen.
The bowler starts his steady run,
Beneath the hot and summer sun.
With crimson leather, hard and bright,
He aims to set the stumps alight.
The batsman waits with focused eye,
As white-clad figures stand nearby.
A gentle push, a thunderous roar,
The ball flies fast to find the four.
Or silken touch of willow-wood,
That makes the crowd feel life is good.
"Howzat!" the fielders loudly shout,
In hope to turn the batsman out.
A game of tactics, patience, skill,
That tests the nerves and brings the thrill.
From morning tea to setting sun,
The noble battle has been won.
A timeless game, a story spun,
Where friendship thrives when day is done.
